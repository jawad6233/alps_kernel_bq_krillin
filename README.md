# Compilation guide:
  
  * First, made a folder for cm kernel and enter to it:

        $ mkdir AOSP_KERNEL

        $ cd AOSP_KERNEL

  * Then, clone the project: 

        $ https://github.com/Pablito2020/cyanogenmod_kernel_bq_krillin.git

  * After that, clone the toolchain used in this build (in that case gcc 4.8): 

        $ git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.8

  * And for compile do that:

        $ cd cyanogenmod_kernel_bq_krillin

        $ . build.sh
